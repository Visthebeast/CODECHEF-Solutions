You are given an array A = [A1, A2,...,An]=[A 
1,A2,…,An].
Is it possible to partition AA into two non-empty subsequences S1 and S2 such that sum(S1)xsum(S2) is odd?

Here, sum(S1)sum denotes the sum of elements in S1, and sum(S2) is defined similarly.

Note: S1​ and S2 must partition A, that is:S1 and S2 must be non-empty
Every element of A must be in either S1 or S2
S1 and S2 must be disjoint (in terms of which indices their subsequences represent)
