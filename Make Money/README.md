Chef has NN bags and an integer X. The ith bag contains Ai coins such that Ai<=X 
In one operation, Chef can:
-Pick any bag and increase its coins to XX. Formally, if he choses the ith bag, he can set Ai = X
Given that the cost of performing each operation is C(Câ‰¤X) coins and Chef can perform the above operation any (possibly zero) number of times, determine the maximum value of:

$\sum_{i=1}^N A_i$ $-$ total cost paid by Chef, if Chef performs the operations optimally.
